                <p>
                    Nature provides us all with so many wonderful and useful things. From beautiful sights, to food & shelter, to maintaining the delicate balance necessary to sustain life on this planet. Mother Nature works very hard to ensure that life can exist (and coexist) in the driest deserts, and the lushest rainforests. As industry advances and the human footprint spreads, the delicacy of this balance increases more and more. As a result, it is ever-important that we do our due diligence in helping nature to thrive, however we can. That starts with taking care of the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, a clean environment is vital to not only to our own healthy living, but survival of all living things. The air we breathe is the most essential resource that the environment provides us with, and our efforts to reduce air pollution are currently not even pacing the pollution being pumped into the air daily (especially in major cities). According to the EPA, air pollution may increase risk of heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis, and premature mortality. There is also evidence to suggest that most indoor air can be up to five times more toxic than it is outdoors. But air pollution is not the only type of pollution we should be concerned with. The CDC also warns that water pollution may increase risks of gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. When you think of the environment as something that may actually be hurting us if we don’t take care of it, the need for a resolution becomes much clearer.

            <h2 class="topicTitle">Humans impact on the environment</h2>
            <div class="topicContent">
                <p>Humans, though often unintentionally, have the most detrimental impact on the environment. However, there are a multitude of ways in which we help the environment as well. That is to say our impact on the environment can be positive or negative, necessary yet cleaner, or unnecessary & discarded. Our way of life currently dictates that some pollution is going to occur regardless of what we do in our everyday lives. Life is chemistry, and chemical reactions are happening everywhere that help us to accomplish amazing feats that are essential to the more hassle-free times we live in today. Currently, efforts are underway all over the world to develop newer and cleaner energy sources to power our homes, run our cars, and light up the night. The combined efforts have been showing progress in many different ways. You can help by getting involved with conservation, volunteering, and staying in contact your local environmental government agencies.</p>
