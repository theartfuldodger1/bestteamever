why should we save the environment? 

Nature provides us all with so many wonderful and useful things. From beautiful sights, to food & shelter, to maintaining the delicate balance necessary to sustain life on this planet. Mother Nature works very hard to ensure that life can exist (and coexist) in the driest deserts, and the lushest rainforests. As industry advances and the human footprint spreads, the delicacy of this balance increases more and more. As a result, it is ever-important that we do our due diligence in helping nature to thrive, however we can. That starts with taking care of the environment.

First and foremost, a clean environment is vital to not only to our own healthy living, but survival of all living things. The air we breathe is the most essential resource that the environment provides us with, and our efforts to reduce air pollution are currently not even pacing the pollution being pumped into the air daily (especially in major cities). According to the EPA, air pollution may increase risk of heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis, and premature mortality. There is also evidence to suggest that most indoor air can be up to five times more toxic than it is outdoors. But air pollution is not the only type of pollution we should be concerned with. The CDC also warns that water pollution may increase risks of gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. When you think of the environment as something that may actually be hurting us if we don’t take care of it, the need for a resolution becomes much clearer.

Humans impact on the environment:

Humans, though often unintentionally, have the most detrimental impact on the environment. However, there are a multitude of ways in which we help the environment as well. That is to say our impact on the environment can be positive or negative, necessary yet cleaner, or unnecessary & discarded. Our way of life currently dictates that some pollution is going to occur regardless of what we do in our everyday lives. Life is chemistry, and chemical reactions are happening everywhere that help us to accomplish amazing feats that are essential to the more hassle-free times we live in today. Currently, efforts are underway all over the world to develop newer and cleaner energy sources to power our homes, run our cars, and light up the night. The combined efforts have been showing progress in many different ways. You can help by getting involved with conservation, volunteering, and staying in contact your local environmental government agencies.

Things you can do to help the environment:

The importance of caring for the environment is absolutely paramount for many reasons. Perhaps most importantly, we need to make sure that we leave this place better than when we came for the next generations whose job(s) it will be to also look after the planet. It wouldn’t be fair to hand them something we fouled up that they are responsible for cleaning up. With that in mind, here are a few ways to take care of our environment:

1.­ Pay attention to how you use water. The little things can make a big difference. Every time you turn off the water while you're brushing your teeth, you're doing something good. Got a leaky toilet? You might be wasting 200 gallons (757 liters) of water a day. Try drinking tap water instead of bottled water, so you aren't wasting all that packaging as well. Wash your clothes in cold water when you can.

2. Leave your car at home. If you can stay off the road just two days a week, you'll reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 1,590 pounds (721 kilograms) per year [source: EPA]. Combine your errands -- hit the post office, grocery store and shoe repair place in one trip. It will save you gas and time.

3. Walk or ride your bike to work, school and anywhere you can. You can reduce greenhouse gases while burning some calories and improving your health. If you can't walk or bike, use mass transit or carpool. Every car not on the road makes a difference.

4. Recycle.You can help reduce pollution just by putting that soda can in a different bin. If you're trying to choose between two products, pick the one with the least packaging. If an office building of 7,000 workers recycled all of its office paper waste for a year, it would be the equivalent of taking almost 400 cars off the road [source: EPA].

5. Compost. Think about how much trash you make in a year. Reducing the amount of solid waste you produce in a year means taking up less space in landfills, so your tax dollars can work somewhere else. Plus, compost makes a great natural fertilizer. Composting is easier than you think.

6. Change your light bulbs. Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) last 10 times longer than a standard bulb and use at least two-thirds less energy. If you're shopping for new appliances or even home electronics, look for ENERGY STAR products, which have met EPA and U.S. Department of Energy guidelines for energy efficiency. As of December 2013, ENERGY STAR had helped families and businesses to save an estimated $295 billion on utility bills and prevented more than 2.3 billion tons (2.1 billion metric tons) of greenhouse gas emissions from being released over the past two decades [source: ENERGY STAR]. (Learn more about proper disposal of CFLs.)

7. Make your home more energy efficient (and save money). Clean your air filters so your system doesn't have to work overtime. Get a programmable thermostat so you aren't wasting energy when you aren't home. When you go to bed, reduce the thermostat setting -- you won't miss those extra degrees of heat or air conditioning while you're asleep.

8. Maintain your car. Underinflated tires decrease fuel economy by up to 3 percent and lead to increased pollution and higher greenhouse gas emissions [source: EPA]. Underinflation also increases tire wear, so it will save you money in the long run if you're good about checking your tire pressure.

9. Drive smarter. Slow down -- driving 60 miles (96 kilometers) per hour instead of 70 mph on the highway will save you up 4 miles (6 kilometers) per gallon [source: Consumer Guide Automotive]. Accelerating and braking too hard can actually reduce your fuel economy, so take it easy on the brakes and gas pedal.

10.Turn off lights when you're not in the room and unplug appliances when you're not using them. It only takes a second to be environmentally conscious.
